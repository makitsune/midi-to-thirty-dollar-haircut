# midi to thirty dollar haircut converter

only supports one track at a time, and you'll need to tweak the numbers to get it working, but

- `npm install`
- get a single-track MIDI (some good ones here: <https://bmp.trotlinebeercan.com/>)
- edit the bottom of `index.js`
- load `out.ðŸ—¿` on https://gdcolon.com/%F0%9F%97%BF
